Dartmouth Bikes <Dartmouth.Bikes@dartmouth.edu>,Open Bike Shop Hours (Free Lube!) Tuesday Mornings,Open shop hours are available for the community each Tuesday morning from 8:30 AM - 10 AM. This will be the second to last one of the term! Stop by to put some free lube on your crusty chains  air in your cold tires  or fix something wrong with your bike! If you can‚Äôt make it during these times  Collis Front Desk also has a bike pump to check-out for a few minutes at a time. Find us in the basement of Fahey Hall! We believe that the best way to fix an abandoned bike is by preventing its abandonment in the first place  so the more knowledgeable students are about their own bike and how to fix it  the less likely they will be to abandon them. One or more of our student interns will be in the shop during our open shop hours to provide limited help if needed  but please know that this is largely a ‚Äúfix it yourself‚Äù time  and we can point you to numerous online and print resources for you to learn from. Any parts required other than lube and air will still be priced according to our pricing scheme here. [Bike-mechanic GIFs - Get the best GIF on GIPHY] Note that these are different from appointment hours  where a mechanic fixes your bike for you  which must be booked on our website. We hope open shop hours are useful for everyone  and this requires your cooperation‚Äîplease be respectful of our intern‚Äôs time and book an appointment for any highly-involved fixes or repairs you do not feel comfortable doing yourself. This is not a time for you to get ‚Äúfree appointments‚Äù. Also  be aware that if you are unable to fix your bike within the time given  you are not permitted to store your bike within the shop‚Äîwe are already lacking space as is. Please also respect our shop and keep things neater than you found them after using our tools and space.
